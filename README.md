This is the firmware for our microcontrollers in our Autonomous Irrigation System. 
This System is to:
- be controlled entirely wirelessly through an IOS app
- log historical data of all operations every 10 seconds
- use Matric Potential data to save water and increase yield
- be as low energy as possible
- be as cheap as possible
